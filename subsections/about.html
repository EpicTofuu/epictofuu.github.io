deleted all the archived stuff thank god! More changes coming to the website soon!

<h2> So who is this Shieyn kid? </h2>
<p>
Some weeb who thinks they can write games and make "music". He likes to boast his <a href="..\index.html">social media</a> in his website and talk about himself in third person.
Honestly, I have no idea wha to fill this in with.
<br><br>
I like to play some video games but not anything notable. In terms of games I've made, I have lots of "Work in progress" games, mainly just projects
I'll never finish. For the most part, my 2D games are made in <a href = "https://github.com/Shieyn/Sh.Framework"> Sh.Framework </a> (my homemade "framework")
and my 3D games are made in <a href = "https://unity3d.com/"> unity engine </a>
<br><br>
People like to say my music is cancer, and (in short) <a href="https://soundcloud.com/epictofu69" target="_blank">it is</a> however with my newest surge in creativity
I've been working hard to release my latest album.
<br><br>
<h2> ..and what's this about a tumblr blog and twitter</h2>
<p>
Twitter is unavoidable, despite the fact all those normies use it (reeee) a bunch of other (more respectable) people use the service, it's also just too damn
useful. And no, I'm not an edgy teen who uses tumblr to talk about how much they hate their life. It's a convinient blogging service that allows me to create
seperate webpages with blogs on them really easily. or i can always use jekyll haaahahahah
</p>
<h2> Hay! what is this shieyn-w thing </h2>
<p>
so it looks like github has a thing where you can sort repositories. I'm using this so my github profile isn't full of shitty websites. I guess it also eases
on the url for some websites. What a bonus!
