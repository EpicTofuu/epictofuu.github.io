<p>
introducing my new, redone website! Better file structure, sicc javascript. But anyway, you're here to examine my innards.
<br><br>
<h2> So who is this SheiTofu kid? </h2>
<p>
Some weeb who can write games and make "music". He likes to boast his <a href="..\index.html">social media</a> in his website and talk about himself in third person.
Honestly, I have no idea wha to fill this in with.
<br><br>
I like to play some video games but not anything notable. In terms of games I've made, I have lots of "Work in progress" games, mainly just projects
I'll never finish. I make my games in <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> engine (I hate my life) however I am currently learning
how to use <a href = "http://www.monogame.net/" target = "_blank"> monogame framework. </a> Soon, I'll be able to create games entirely from a framework.
I have a working monogame test which you can examine below:

<br><br>
People like to say my music is cancer, and (in short) <a href="https://soundcloud.com/epictofu69" target="_blank">it is</a>, however, I am making a new album (after finishing the current) featuring new songs with sounds that
I have made myself and melodies that run off a chord progression (yes, I made my music by putting random notes together 8) )! I make my music with <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/" target="_blank">FL Studio 12 </a>
(like everyone else) however I will consider, and maybe even poke at, Reason 9 (<a href="https://www.propellerheads.se/" target="_blank">by Propellerhead</a>). Also I'll be moving over to <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a> soon, so look out for that.
<br><br>
If you are still reading this, I congratulate you, now go away, I'm sure you have other things to do.
