<h1>
About
</h1>

<p>
introducing my new, redone website! Better file structure, cleaner aesthetic. But anyway, you're here to examine my innards.
<br><br>
<h2> So who is this Shenei kid? </h2>
<p>
Some weeb who changes their name way too often and can write games and make "music". He likes to boast his <a href="..\index.html">social media</a> in his website and talk about himself in third person.
Honestly, I have no idea wha to fill this in with.
<br><br>
I like to play some video games but not anything notable. In terms of games I've made, I have lots of "Work in progress" games, mainly just projects
I'll never finish. I make my games in <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> engine (I hate my life) however I am currently learning
how to use <a href = "http://www.monogame.net/" target = "_blank"> monogame framework. </a> Soon, I'll be able to create games entirely from a framework.
I have a working monogame test which you can examine below:

<br><br>
People like to say my music is cancer, and (in short) <a href="https://soundcloud.com/epictofu69" target="_blank">it is</a>. In all honesty, I have lost
all motivation to make music. I just don't feel the joy of making catchy melodies like I used to, at least, for the time being. Of course I'm not incapable
of working a DAW, I can create quick tracks if need be however my soundcloud right now is pretty inactive. In the event that I do want to make music again however
I'll create a newgrounds account to host all my music on.
<br><br>
<h2> ..and what's this about a blog </h2>
<p>
instead of writing long messages on something shitty like twitter, I can use a blog. I intend on creating one to update everyone on development and things
going on in my life which may be of s o m e importance. Jekyll however is being really annoying so pushing out a blog is a massive pain. If anyone
knows how to deploy a jekyll blog, please tell me. <br><br>
If you are still reading this, I congratulate you, now go away, I'm sure you have other things to do.
