Here is my new, renovated website. Better file structure, better code.

I have made a concious effort to organise files. In my old website, I had massive css scripts in each and every single one of my pages.
Everything was in my root folder and in the end, I had no idea how my website worked anymore. So I've created a new website, one that does
more than just "work".

Additionally, I have created a blog with jekyll, some thing that allows me to create static blogs or something idfk. I'll be able to post more
in future because of the automated system jekyll provides me with.
